			<p>Welcome to <em>House of Kicks</em>, your number one source for all things footwear. We're dedicated to giving you the very best footwear, with a focus on fast shipping, customer service and a wide variety of options.
Founded in 2019 by Ismael Ferreira, House of Kicks has come a long way from its beginnings in a home office. When Ismael first started out, his passion for sneaker culture drove him to understanding the market, and gave him the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into to a booming online store. We now serve customers all over United States, and are thrilled to be a part of the modern wing of the online sneaker industry.

We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.

Sincerely,
Ismael Ferreira, CEO</p>
